# Produce

The world's simplest productivity app. Add what you want to do, set a timer (with breaks!) and get stuff done!

## About

I made this project as an extremely simple way to just make a quick todo list and get a couple things done. I wanted the simplest & fastest
way to do this, as well as a site that looked really nice, and without making an account.

## Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/mrdiamonddog/produce`
